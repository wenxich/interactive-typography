# interactive-typography
Playing around with creating interactive typography using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.

**Files include:**
- warm.js (Description: the word "warm", which expands in size as you move your mouse from left to right; the background also changes from orange and fades to sunlight-like yellow-to-white as you move your mouse from left to right)
